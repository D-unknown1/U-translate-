# Fixes Applied - GPU, System Audio, and Live Captions

## Summary of Changes

This update addresses all the issues mentioned:

### âœ… 1. GPU/CUDA Detection and Usage

**Problem:** Application was not using GPU despite CUDA being installed.

**Fixes:**
- Enhanced `GPUManager` class with improved CUDA detection
- Added explicit CUDA initialization attempt if not initially detected
- Added detailed GPU logging to help diagnose detection issues
- Logs now show:
  - CUDA availability status
  - GPU device name (if CUDA available)
  - CUDA version
  - Device count
  - Warning messages if CUDA expected but not found

**What to check:**
- Run the app and look for log messages like:
  ```
  CUDA detected: <GPU Name>
  CUDA version: <version>
  WhisperModelManager initialized with device: cuda
  ```
- If CUDA is still not detected, the logs will show why
- Make sure PyTorch is installed with CUDA support: `python -c "import torch; print(torch.cuda.is_available())"`

### âœ… 2. System Audio Recognition Fixed

**Problem:** Qt threading errors when using system audio capture.

**Fixes:**
- Added proper thread synchronization with locks for audio buffer
- Improved error handling in audio callback
- Better thread safety when submitting audio for processing
- Fixed thread pool executor shutdown logic
- Added proper exception handling for thread operations

### âœ… 3. Google Live Captions-Style Subtitle Overlay

**Problem:** Subtitle overlay needed better updating with smooth transitions.

**Implemented:**
- **Real-time word-by-word updates** - Text appears as it's being transcribed
- **Smooth scrolling** - Last 3 lines visible with auto-scrolling
- **Sentence detection** - Automatically wraps at sentence endings (., !, ?, etc.)
- **Fade animations** - Smooth fade-in transitions for new text (30 FPS)
- **Configurable settings:**
  - `live_captions_mode`: Enable/disable live captions mode (default: true)
  - `subtitle_lines`: Number of lines to show (default: 3)
  
**Features:**
- Shows last N lines (configurable, default 3)
- Current sentence builds word-by-word at bottom
- Completed sentences scroll up
- Auto-wraps at ~12 words or sentence punctuation
- Smooth fade transitions between updates
- Updates at ~30 FPS for fluid motion

### âœ… 4. Qt Threading Errors Fixed

**Problem:** Timer warnings and thread safety issues.

**Fixes:**
- All signal connections now use `Qt.ConnectionType.QueuedConnection` for thread-safe communication
- Added `update_status_safe()` method using `QMetaObject.invokeMethod` for thread-safe UI updates
- Added `handle_recognition_error()` for thread-safe error handling
- Proper separation of worker threads and UI thread operations

### âœ… 5. Overlay Geometry Issues Fixed

**Problem:** Windows geometry warnings and sizing constraints.

**Fixes:**
- Added `_validate_geometry()` method to ensure valid window dimensions
- Relaxed minimum size constraints (135x57 to match Windows requirements)
- Added screen bounds checking to prevent off-screen windows
- Proper error handling when setting geometry
- Validates geometry on both creation and resize

## Testing the Changes

### Test GPU Usage:
1. Start the application
2. Check the startup logs for GPU detection messages
3. Look for: `WhisperModelManager device set to: cuda` (instead of cpu)
4. The main window should show GPU status in top bar
5. Try using Whisper recognition engine - it should be much faster on GPU

### Test Live Captions:
1. Start continuous listening
2. Speak some sentences
3. Watch the overlay window - text should appear word-by-word
4. After ~12 words or a sentence ending, text should scroll up
5. Only last 3 lines should be visible
6. Transitions should be smooth with subtle fades

### Test System Audio:
1. Click "ðŸŽ§ System Audio" button to switch source
2. Enable "Stereo Mix" in Windows (if on Windows)
3. Start listening
4. Play audio on your computer
5. Should capture and transcribe system audio without threading errors

## Configuration Options

New config options in `translator_config.json`:
```json
{
  "live_captions_mode": true,  // Enable Google Live Captions style
  "subtitle_lines": 3,          // Number of subtitle lines to show
  "use_gpu": true               // Use GPU if available
}
```

## Known Limitations

1. **CUDA Detection:** If CUDA is still not detected:
   - Verify PyTorch was installed with CUDA support
   - Check CUDA drivers are properly installed
   - Try: `pip install torch torchvision torchaudio --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu118`

2. **System Audio on Windows:** Requires "Stereo Mix" to be enabled in Windows audio settings

3. **Overlay Animations:** Some very old GPUs may have issues with opacity effects

## Files Modified

- `app.py` - All changes applied to main application file

## Next Steps

If GPU is still not working:
1. Check the logs for the exact error message
2. Run: `python -c "import torch; print(torch.cuda.is_available(), torch.version.cuda)"`
3. Ensure NVIDIA drivers are up to date
4. Consider reinstalling PyTorch with CUDA support
